Ever since I discovered that the Gemini 2.0 multimodal LLM is freely available for a limited time, I was eager to explore its potential. With the new year offering a fresh start, I decided to create a simple yet impactful app that calculates calorie intake from a picture of food. I'm thrilled to announce that my **Calorie Calculator App** is now live and successfully deployed on **Azure Cloud** using **Docker** and **Azure App Service**!
